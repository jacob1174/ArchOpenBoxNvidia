OpenBox Scripts for Arch Linux systems

I got tired of installing everything I needed and then having to reinstall on another computer.
The idea was for me to start the process, go have lunch, take a nap, and be finished.

I would like to thank Erik Dubois at ArcoLinux in giving me advice and assistance for creating these files and giving me inspiration to make the necessary changes to support my needs.
